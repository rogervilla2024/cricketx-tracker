            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cricket X, like all gambling games, carries inherent risks. With a 3% house edge, the game is mathematically designed for players to lose money over time. However, many people choose to play for entertainment, and for them, following responsible gambling practices is essential.</p>

        <section id="tip-1">
            <h2>Tip 1: Set a Strict Budget Before Playing</h2>
            <p>The most important rule in gambling is to set a budget before you start and stick to it absolutely.</p>

            <h3>How to Set a Gambling Budget</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Calculate your disposable income:</strong> After all bills, savings, and necessary expenses</li>
                <li><strong>Determine entertainment allocation:</strong> What you'd spend on movies, dining out, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Set a gambling portion:</strong> A fraction of your entertainment budget</li>
                <li><strong>Treat it as spent:</strong> Consider this money gone the moment you allocate it</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The Budget Rule</h3>
            <div class="formula-box">
                <p><strong>Never gamble money you need for:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rent or mortgage</li>
                    <li>Bills and utilities</li>
                    <li>Food and essentials</li>
                    <li>Debt payments</li>
                    <li>Savings goals</li>
                    <li>Family obligations</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Practical Budget Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use a separate account:</strong> Transfer your gambling budget to a separate account</li>
                <li><strong>Don't link credit cards:</strong> Use only debit or prepaid cards</li>
                <li><strong>Set daily/weekly limits:</strong> Don't blow monthly budget in one session</li>
                <li><strong>Write it down:</strong> Physically record your budget before each session</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When You Reach Your Budget</h3>
            <p><strong>Stop immediately.</strong> No exceptions. No "one more round." No "just trying to get even." The budget exists precisely for moments when you want to exceed it.</p>

        <section id="tip-2">
            <h2>Tip 2: Never Chase Losses</h2>
            <p>Chasing losses is one of the most destructive behaviors in gambling. It leads to the spiral that creates serious gambling problems.</p>

            <h3>What is Loss Chasing?</h3>
            <p>Loss chasing is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Betting more after losses to "recover"</li>
                <li>Extending sessions beyond planned limits after losing</li>
                <li>Depositing more money when your budget is exhausted</li>
                <li>Believing you're "due" for a win after losses</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Loss Chasing Always Fails</h3>
            <p>Mathematical reality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each bet has the same -3% expected value regardless of past results</li>
                <li>Previous losses don't increase your chances of winning</li>
                <li>Increased bets only increase potential losses</li>
                <li>The house edge applies to every bet, making recovery statistically unlikely</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Chasing Spiral</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lose initial budget</li>
                <li>Deposit more to recover</li>
                <li>Often lose that too</li>
                <li>Deposit even more</li>
                <li>Continue until serious financial damage occurs</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>How to Avoid Chasing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Accept losses as the cost of entertainment</li>
                <li>Remember: losing is the expected outcome</li>
                <li>Leave immediately when budget is reached</li>
                <li>Don't keep payment methods accessible while playing</li>
                <li>Take a break before considering any additional deposits</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="tip-3">
            <h2>Tip 3: Use Platform Safety Tools</h2>
            <p>Reputable gambling platforms offer responsible gambling tools. Use them all.</p>

            <h3>Deposit Limits</h3>
            <p>Set daily, weekly, and monthly deposit limits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Match these to your predetermined budget</li>
                <li>Once hit, you cannot deposit more until the period resets</li>
                <li>Create friction between impulse and action</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Loss Limits</h3>
            <p>Some platforms offer loss limits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set maximum losses per session or period</li>
                <li>Platform locks you out when reached</li>
                <li>Prevents catastrophic sessions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Session Time Limits</h3>
            <p>Set how long you can play:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Receive notifications when approaching limit</li>
                <li>Automatic logout when time expires</li>
                <li>Prevents marathon gambling sessions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reality Check Notifications</h3>
            <p>Periodic reminders showing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How long you've been playing</li>
                <li>How much you've won or lost</li>
                <li>Force acknowledgment to continue</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Self-Exclusion</h3>
            <p>If you need stronger measures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Temporary self-exclusion (days to months)</li>
                <li>Permanent self-exclusion</li>
                <li>Cannot be easily reversed</li>
                <li>Use if other measures aren't working</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Activate Tools</h3>
            <p>Look for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Responsible Gambling" section in account settings</li>
                <li>Contact customer support to enable restrictions</li>
                <li>Third-party self-exclusion services (like GamStop in UK)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="tip-4">
            <h2>Tip 4: Understand the Mathematics</h2>
            <p>Knowledge is protection. Understanding how Cricket X works mathematically helps set realistic expectations.</p>

            <h3>The Fundamental Facts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RTP:</strong> 97% - for every $100 wagered, $97 returns on average</li>
                <li><strong>House Edge:</strong> 3% - casino keeps 3% of all money wagered</li>
                <li><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> Loss - you're expected to lose over time</li>
                <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Each round is separate - past doesn't predict future</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What This Means Practically</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you wager $1,000 total, expect to lose ~$30</li>
                <li>Short-term wins don't change long-term expectations</li>
                <li>No pattern or strategy can change the mathematics</li>
                <li>You're paying for entertainment, not investing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Myths to Reject</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patterns exist:</strong> No - rounds are independent</li>
                <li><strong>Wins are due:</strong> No - probability doesn't work that way</li>
                <li><strong>Strategies work:</strong> No - house edge is mathematical</li>
                <li><strong>Some times are better:</strong> No - RNG doesn't know the time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Use Knowledge Wisely</h3>
            <p>Understanding math should lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accepting losses as normal and expected</li>
                <li>Not chasing mythical patterns</li>
                <li>Treating gambling as entertainment expense</li>
                <li>Making informed decisions about participation</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="tip-5">
            <h2>Tip 5: Avoid Playing Under the Influence</h2>
            <p>Alcohol, drugs, and extreme emotions impair judgment. Never gamble when impaired.</p>

            <h3>Why Substances Are Dangerous for Gambling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impaired judgment:</strong> Worse decision-making</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced inhibition:</strong> More likely to chase losses</li>
                <li><strong>Budget blindness:</strong> Forget or ignore limits</li>
                <li><strong>Increased risk-taking:</strong> Bigger, more reckless bets</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Emotional States to Avoid</h3>
            <p>Don't gamble when feeling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Angry:</strong> May gamble aggressively</li>
                <li><strong>Depressed:</strong> May use gambling to escape</li>
                <li><strong>Stressed:</strong> May make poor decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Euphoric:</strong> May overestimate abilities</li>
                <li><strong>Desperate:</strong> May see gambling as solution</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Warning Signs</h3>
            <p>If you're gambling to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Escape problems</li>
                <li>Feel better emotionally</li>
                <li>Celebrate by taking risks</li>
                <li>Cope with stress</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Stop immediately.</strong> This indicates gambling is becoming a coping mechanism.</p>

            <h3>Healthy Gambling State</h3>
            <p>Only gamble when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sober and clear-minded</li>
                <li>Emotionally stable</li>
                <li>Within your budget</li>
                <li>Viewing it purely as entertainment</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="tip-6">
            <h2>Tip 6: Set Time Limits</h2>
            <p>Cricket X's fast pace makes time fly. Time limits prevent marathon sessions that lead to problems.</p>

            <h3>Why Time Matters</h3>
            <p>Cricket X rounds last 20-30 seconds. In one hour:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You might play 120-180 rounds</li>
                <li>With $1 bets, that's $120-$180 wagered</li>
                <li>Expected loss: $3.60-$5.40 per hour</li>
                <li>Longer sessions = more losses</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Set Time Limits</h3>
            <ul>

            <h2>Tip 8: Treat It as Entertainment, Not Income</h2>
            <p>The most important mindset shift for safe gambling is viewing it correctly.</p>

            <h3>Gambling is Entertainment</h3>
            <p>Think of gambling like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Going to the movies (you pay for the experience)</li>
                <li>Playing video games (you pay for fun, not profit)</li>
                <li>Visiting an amusement park (cost for entertainment)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gambling is NOT</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>An investment strategy</li>
                <li>A way to make money</li>
                <li>A solution to financial problems</li>
                <li>A career or side hustle</li>
                <li>A reliable income source</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Entertainment Cost Frame</h3>
            <p>Before gambling, ask:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Am I willing to pay $X for this entertainment?"</li>
                <li>"Would I be happy if I lose this entire amount?"</li>
                <li>"Is this the best use of my entertainment budget?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Wins Are Bonuses, Not Expectations</h3>
            <p>If you win:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider it a lucky bonus</li>
                <li>Don't expect it to happen regularly</li>
                <li>Don't increase future gambling based on past wins</li>
                <li>Consider withdrawing and enjoying the extra money</li>
            </ul>
