        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Gambling, including playing Cricket X, carries inherent risks beyond financial loss. Problem gambling is a recognized behavioral disorder that can devastate lives, relationships, and financial stability. This guide provides comprehensive information about recognizing, preventing, and addressing gambling problems.</p>

            <p>This article is not about helping you gamble "better" or win more. It's about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding when gambling becomes harmful</li>
                <li>Recognizing warning signs in yourself and others</li>
                <li>Learning about protective measures and tools</li>
                <li>Finding help if you need it</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you're reading this because you're concerned about your gambling, that concern itself is meaningful. Please read on and consider seeking support.</p>

        <section id="understanding">
            <h2>Understanding Problem Gambling</h2>
            <p>Problem gambling exists on a spectrum, from mild negative impacts to severe gambling disorder.</p>

            <h3>What is Problem Gambling?</h3>
            <p>Problem gambling is defined as gambling behavior that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creates negative consequences in your life</li>
                <li>Is difficult to control or stop</li>
                <li>Continues despite harmful effects</li>
                <li>Consumes increasing time, money, or mental energy</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gambling Disorder</h3>
            <p>Gambling Disorder is recognized in the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) as a behavioral addiction. It's characterized by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior</li>
                <li>Clinically significant impairment or distress</li>
                <li>Meeting specific diagnostic criteria (see self-assessment section)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Gambling Can Become Addictive</h3>
            <p>Several factors make gambling potentially addictive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Variable reinforcement:</strong> Unpredictable wins are more psychologically powerful than predictable ones</li>
                <li><strong>Near misses:</strong> Almost winning feels almost like winning, encouraging continued play</li>
                <li><strong>Dopamine response:</strong> Gambling triggers brain reward pathways similar to substance use</li>
                <li><strong>Escape mechanism:</strong> Gambling can temporarily distract from problems</li>
                <li><strong>Illusion of control:</strong> Cash-out decisions in games like Cricket X create false sense of skill</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who is At Risk?</h3>
            <p>Anyone can develop gambling problems, but risk factors include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Family history of addiction</li>
                <li>Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, ADHD)</li>
                <li>Personality traits (impulsivity, competitiveness)</li>
                <li>Early gambling exposure</li>
                <li>Substance use issues</li>
                <li>Certain medications (dopamine agonists)</li>
                <li>Life stressors and trauma</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>DSM-5 Based Questions</h3>

            <ol>

                <li>Gambled when feeling distressed (helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed)?</li>
                <li>After losing money gambling, often returned another day to get even ("chased" losses)?</li>

                <li>Relied on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0 criteria:</strong> No gambling disorder indicated</li>
                <li><strong>1-3 criteria:</strong> At-risk gambling / Mild disorder</li>

                <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you answered "yes" to ANY of these questions, please consider reaching out to a gambling support service. Even one positive response indicates potential risk.</p>

            </ul>

        <section id="cricket-x-risks">
            <h2>Specific Risks of Cricket X</h2>
            <p>Certain characteristics of Cricket X create specific risk factors.</p>

            <h3>Fast-Paced Gameplay</h3>
            <p>Cricket X rounds last 20-30 seconds. This creates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapid betting cycles (120+ rounds per hour possible)</li>
                <li>Quick accumulation of losses</li>
                <li>Less time to reflect between bets</li>
                <li>Difficulty tracking total wagered</li>
                <li>Time distortion (hours pass quickly)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Cash-Out Illusion</h3>
            <p>The cash-out decision creates false sense of skill:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Players feel they "control" outcomes</li>
                <li>Near-misses feel preventable</li>
                <li>Regret over "wrong" decisions encourages more play</li>
                <li>Success attributed to skill, failure to bad luck</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>High Multiplier Potential</h3>
            <p>The 10,000x maximum creates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Powerful attraction and fantasy of big wins</li>
                <li>Rationalization for continued losses</li>
                <li>"Next round could be the big one" thinking</li>
                <li>Underestimation of true probabilities</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>24/7 Availability</h3>
            <p>Online accessibility means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No physical barriers to gambling</li>
                <li>Available during vulnerable moments</li>
                <li>Can gamble in private without oversight</li>
                <li>Easy to hide extent of play</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cricket Theme Appeal</h3>
            <p>For cricket fans, the theme may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lower perceived risk ("it's just a game")</li>
                <li>Connect gambling to beloved sport</li>
                <li>Create additional emotional attachment</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="responsible-practices">
            <h2>Responsible Gambling Practices</h2>
            <p>If you choose to gamble, these practices can reduce harm.</p>

            <h3>Before You Gamble</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Set a budget:</strong> Decide maximum loss before playing</li>
                <li><strong>Set time limit:</strong> Decide how long you'll play</li>
                <li><strong>Check your state:</strong> Don't gamble when emotional, stressed, or intoxicated</li>
                <li><strong>Have alternative plans:</strong> Know what you'll do after gambling</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>While Gambling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stick to limits:</strong> Stop when budget or time is reached</li>
                <li><strong>Don't chase losses:</strong> Accept losses as entertainment cost</li>
                <li><strong>Take regular breaks:</strong> Step away every 30-60 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Keep perspective:</strong> Remember it's entertainment, not income</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>After Gambling</h3>
