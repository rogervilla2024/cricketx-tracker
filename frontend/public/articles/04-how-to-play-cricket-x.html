            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to this comprehensive beginner's guide to Cricket X, the cricket-themed crash game developed by SmartSoft Gaming. If you've never played a crash game before, or if you're specifically interested in learning Cricket X, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know.</p>

            <p>Cricket X combines simple mechanics with exciting gameplay, making it accessible to newcomers while still providing the thrills that experienced crash game players enjoy. The game's cricket theme adds a sports element that appeals to cricket fans, though you don't need to know anything about cricket to play.</p>

            <p>Before we begin, remember that Cricket X is a gambling game. It has a 97% RTP (Return to Player), which means the house maintains a 3% edge. Over time, players are expected to lose money. This guide teaches you how to play, not how to win - there is no reliable method to beat the game's mathematics.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="basic-concept">
            <h2>Basic Concept of Cricket X</h2>
            <p>Cricket X is what's known as a "crash game" or "instant win" game. The basic concept is elegantly simple:</p>

            <h3>The Core Mechanic</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>You place a bet before the round starts</li>
                <li>A multiplier begins climbing from 1.00x</li>
                <li>The multiplier can crash (end) at any moment</li>
                <li>You must cash out before the crash to win</li>
                <li>If you cash out, you receive: Bet Amount x Multiplier at Cash Out</li>
                <li>If the game crashes before you cash out, you lose your bet</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The Cricket Theme</h3>
            <p>In Cricket X, the multiplier is visualized through a cricket ball's flight. As the ball travels through the air, the multiplier increases. When the ball is caught or lands, the game "crashes" and the round ends. This visual element makes the experience more engaging but doesn't affect the underlying mathematics.</p>

            <h3>Key Numbers to Know</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RTP:</strong> 97% (Return to Player)</li>
                <li><strong>House Edge:</strong> 3%</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum Multiplier:</strong> 10,000x</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum Crash:</strong> 1.00x (instant crash, you lose immediately)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="game-interface">
            <h2>Understanding the Game Interface</h2>
            <p>Before playing, familiarize yourself with Cricket X's interface. While exact layouts may vary slightly between platforms, most versions include these elements:</p>

            <h3>Main Game Area</h3>
            <p>The center of the screen shows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cricket ball animation:</strong> The visual representation of the current round</li>
                <li><strong>Current multiplier:</strong> A large, updating number showing the current multiplier (e.g., 1.00x, 1.50x, 2.35x)</li>
                <li><strong>Game status:</strong> Whether the game is in betting phase, in progress, or crashed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Betting Panel</h3>
            <p>Usually located at the bottom or side of the screen:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bet amount input:</strong> Where you enter how much to wager</li>
                <li><strong>Quick bet buttons:</strong> Preset amounts for fast betting</li>
                <li><strong>Bet/Cash Out button:</strong> Changes function based on game state</li>
                <li><strong>Auto cash-out setting:</strong> Option to set automatic cash-out multiplier</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>History Panel</h3>
            <p>Typically at the top of the screen:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recent crashes:</strong> Shows multipliers from previous rounds</li>
                <li><strong>Color coding:</strong> Often uses colors to indicate crash levels (red for low, green for high)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Player Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Your current account balance</li>
                <li><strong>Current bet:</strong> Your active bet amount</li>
                <li><strong>Potential win:</strong> What you'll win if you cash out now</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="step-by-step">
            <h2>Step-by-Step: Playing Your First Round</h2>
            <p>Let's walk through playing a complete round of Cricket X.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Wait for Betting Phase</h3>
            <p>Cricket X operates in cycles. After each crash, there's a brief betting window (usually 5-10 seconds) before the next round. Look for indicators like "PLACE YOUR BETS" or a countdown timer.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Enter Your Bet Amount</h3>
            <p>During the betting phase:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on the bet amount field</li>
                <li>Enter your desired bet (or use quick-bet buttons)</li>
                <li>Double-check the amount is correct</li>
                <li>Ensure it's within your budget</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Step 3: Confirm Your Bet</h3>
            <p>Click the "BET" button to confirm your wager. Once confirmed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The bet amount is deducted from your balance</li>
                <li>Your bet is registered for the upcoming round</li>
                <li>You cannot cancel the bet once the round starts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Watch the Multiplier Climb</h3>
            <p>When the betting phase ends:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The cricket ball launches</li>
                <li>The multiplier starts at 1.00x and begins climbing</li>
                <li>The climb speed varies but is generally quick</li>
                <li>Your potential win updates in real-time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Make Your Cash Out Decision</h3>
            <p>This is the crucial moment. You have two choices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash Out:</strong> Click the cash-out button to secure your current winnings (Bet x Multiplier)</li>
                <li><strong>Wait:</strong> Let the multiplier climb higher for bigger potential winnings, risking a crash</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 6: See the Outcome</h3>
            <p>The round ends when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You cash out:</strong> Your winnings are added to your balance</li>
                <li><strong>The game crashes:</strong> If you haven't cashed out, your bet is lost</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 7: Prepare for Next Round</h3>
            <p>The cycle repeats immediately. A new betting phase begins, and you can decide whether to bet again.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="betting-options">
            <h2>Betting Options Explained</h2>
            <p>Cricket X offers several betting options to suit different play styles.</p>

            <h3>Single Bet</h3>
            <p>The simplest option - place one bet per round. This is recommended for beginners as it keeps things straightforward.</p>

            <h3>Dual Bets</h3>
            <p>Most platforms allow two simultaneous bets per round. This enables strategies like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Split strategy:</strong> Cash out one bet early for safety, let the other ride</li>
                <li><strong>Same amount, different targets:</strong> Cash out at 1.5x and 3x, for example</li>
                <li><strong>Different amounts:</strong> Larger safe bet, smaller risky bet</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bet Amount Selection</h3>
            <p>Consider these factors when choosing bet amounts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your total gambling budget for the session</li>
                <li>How many rounds you want to play</li>
                <li>Your risk tolerance</li>
                <li>Platform minimum and maximum bet limits</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bet Timing</h3>
            <p>You can only bet during the betting phase. Bets placed close to the deadline might not register if there's network latency, so don't wait until the last second.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="auto-features">
            <h2>Auto Cash-Out and Auto Bet</h2>
            <p>Cricket X includes automation features that can help remove emotion from decision-making.</p>

            <h3>Auto Cash-Out</h3>
            <p>This feature automatically cashes out when the multiplier reaches a preset value:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Before placing your bet, find the auto cash-out setting</li>
                <li>Enter your target multiplier (e.g., 2.00x)</li>
                <li>Place your bet</li>
                <li>If the round reaches 2.00x, the system cashes out automatically</li>
                <li>If the round crashes before 2.00x, you still lose</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Auto Cash-Out Benefits</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Removes emotion from the cash-out decision</li>
                <li>Ensures you don't miss your target due to slow reactions</li>
                <li>Helps stick to predetermined goals</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Auto Cash-Out Limitations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Doesn't guarantee wins (crash can happen before target)</li>
                <li>Removes opportunity to adapt to each round</li>
                <li>May cash out just before much higher multipliers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Auto Bet</h3>
            <p>Some platforms offer auto-bet functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automatically places bets each round</li>
                <li>Combined with auto cash-out for fully automated play</li>
                <li>Usually allows setting number of rounds or stop-loss limits</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Auto-bet can rapidly deplete your balance. The fast pace of Cricket X means automated betting can cycle through your budget very quickly. Use extreme caution with this feature.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="understanding-outcomes">
            <h2>Understanding Outcomes</h2>
            <p>Let's clarify exactly what happens in different scenarios.</p>

            <h3>Scenario 1: Successful Cash Out</h3>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You bet $10 and cash out at 2.50x</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Winnings: $10 x 2.50 = $25</li>
                <li>Profit: $25 - $10 = $15</li>
                <li>Your balance increases by $25 (the original bet plus profit)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scenario 2: The Crash</h3>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You bet $10, don't cash out, and the game crashes at 3.45x</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Winnings: $0</li>
                <li>Loss: $10 (your entire bet)</li>
                <li>It doesn't matter what multiplier it crashed at - if you didn't cash out, you lose</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scenario 3: Instant Crash (1.00x)</h3>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You bet $10, the game instantly crashes at 1.00x</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You had no chance to cash out</li>
                <li>Your bet is lost immediately</li>
                <li>This occurs approximately 3% of rounds</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scenario 4: Auto Cash-Out Triggers</h3>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You bet $10 with auto cash-out set at 2.00x, round reaches 2.00x</p>
            <ul>
                <li>System automatically cashes out at 2.00x</li>
                <li>Winnings: $10 x 2.00 = $20</li>
                <li>Round continues but you're already out</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scenario 5: Auto Cash-Out Doesn't Trigger</h3>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You bet $10 with auto cash-out at 3.00x, round crashes at 2.75x</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Target wasn't reached before crash</li>
                <li>Auto cash-out doesn't help</li>
                <li>Your bet is lost</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="demo-mode">
            <h2>Demo Mode: Practice Without Risk</h2>
            <p>Many platforms offer demo or free-play versions of Cricket X. This is an excellent way to learn.</p>

            <h3>Benefits of Demo Mode</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No financial risk:</strong> Practice with virtual money</li>
                <li><strong>Learn the interface:</strong> Get comfortable with buttons and features</li>
                <li><strong>Understand timing:</strong> Practice the cash-out timing</li>
                <li><strong>Experience variance:</strong> See how streaks and crashes work</li>
                <li><strong>Test different approaches:</strong> Try various cash-out targets</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitations of Demo Mode</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No real emotional pressure:</strong> Real money changes psychology</li>
                <li><strong>May not reflect real RNG:</strong> Some demos use simplified randomization</li>
                <li><strong>Success in demo doesn't predict real success:</strong> The math is the same</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Use Demo Mode Effectively</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with the demo before depositing real money</li>
                <li>Play at least 50-100 rounds to understand variance</li>
                <li>Practice using auto cash-out features</li>
                <li>Try different bet amounts (relative to demo balance)</li>
                <li>Observe the crash history to understand distribution</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="common-mistakes">
            <h2>Common Beginner Mistakes</h2>
            <p>Avoid these typical errors that new Cricket X players make.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 1: Chasing Losses</h3>
            <p><strong>The error:</strong> After losing, increasing bets to "win back" the lost money.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it's dangerous:</strong> This can rapidly deplete your bankroll. Each round is independent - previous losses don't increase your chances of winning.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 2: Waiting for "Due" High Multipliers</h3>
            <p><strong>The error:</strong> Believing that after many low crashes, a high multiplier is "due."</p>
            <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> This is the Gambler's Fallacy. Each round is independent. Past results don't influence future outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 3: Betting the Entire Budget</h3>
            <p><strong>The error:</strong> Putting all your gambling budget on one or two rounds.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it's dangerous:</strong> Cricket X can crash instantly (1.00x). You need enough rounds to experience the game properly.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 4: No Predefined Limits</h3>
            <p><strong>The error:</strong> Playing without a loss limit or time limit.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it's dangerous:</strong> The fast pace makes it easy to lose track. Set limits before playing.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 5: Emotional Cash-Out Decisions</h3>
            <p><strong>The error:</strong> Making cash-out decisions based on fear or greed in the moment.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it's problematic:</strong> Leads to inconsistent play and regret. Consider using auto cash-out.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 6: Playing Under the Influence</h3>
            <p><strong>The error:</strong> Gambling while intoxicated or impaired.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it's dangerous:</strong> Impairs judgment, leads to bigger bets and chasing losses.</p>

            <h3>Mistake 7: Believing in "Systems"</h3>
            <p><strong>The error:</strong> Using betting "systems" or "strategies" purchased online.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it doesn't work:</strong> No system can overcome the mathematical house edge. Anyone selling such systems is scamming you.</p>

            <h2>Essential Tips for New Players</h2>
            <p>Follow these guidelines for a safer and more enjoyable Cricket X experience.</p>

            <h3>Before Playing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Set a budget:</strong> Decide the maximum you're willing to lose</li>
                <li><strong>Set a time limit:</strong> Decide how long you'll play</li>
                <li><strong>Choose a licensed platform:</strong> Only play on properly regulated sites</li>
                <li><strong>Try demo mode first:</strong> Practice before risking real money</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>During Play</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bet small relative to budget:</strong> Aim for 50+ rounds with your budget</li>
                <li><strong>Consider auto cash-out:</strong> Removes emotional decision-making</li>
                <li><strong>Don't chase losses:</strong> Accept losses as the cost of entertainment</li>
                <li><strong>Take breaks:</strong> Step away regularly to maintain perspective</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>After Playing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stop at your limit:</strong> Whether winning or losing, stick to your budget</li>
                <li><strong>Reflect honestly:</strong> Was it entertainment or problematic?</li>
                <li><strong>Don't try to win back:</strong> If you lost, don't deposit more to recover</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Understanding the Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accept the house edge:</strong> The 3% edge means long-term loss is expected</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace variance:</strong> Winning and losing streaks are normal</li>
                <li><strong>Ignore patterns:</strong> Historical results don't predict future outcomes</li>
                <li><strong>No skill involved:</strong> Crash point is random; "skill" is an illusion</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Warning</h3>
                <p><strong>Gambling can be addictive and harmful.</strong> Cricket X has a house edge, meaning you are expected to lose money over time. Never gamble more than you can afford to lose. Never gamble to solve financial problems.</p>

                <li>Spending more money than you can afford</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>How do I know when to cash out?</h3>
            <p>There's no "right" time mathematically - the expected value is the same regardless of cash-out target. Many beginners use auto cash-out at low multipliers (1.5x-2x) to secure frequent small wins, but this doesn't change the overall expected loss due to the house edge.</p>

            <h3>Can I cancel a bet after placing it?</h3>
            <p>Once the betting phase ends and the round begins, bets cannot be cancelled. You can only cancel during the betting phase before the round starts.</p>

            <h3>What happens if my internet disconnects?</h3>
            <p>If you have auto cash-out set, it should still trigger (processed server-side). Without auto cash-out, policies vary by platform - check the terms of service.</p>

            <h3>Is there a minimum bet?</h3>
            <p>Yes, but it varies by platform. Common minimums are $0.10 to $1.00. Check your chosen platform's rules.</p>

            <h3>Can I play on my phone?</h3>
            <p>Yes, Cricket X is typically mobile-optimized. It works in mobile browsers and sometimes through dedicated apps.</p>

            <h3>Why did the game crash instantly?</h3>
            <p>Crashes at 1.00x occur approximately 3% of the time. This is part of the game's mathematical design. It's frustrating but not a malfunction.</p>

            <h3>Is Cricket X fair?</h3>
            <p>If played on a licensed platform, Cricket X uses provably fair technology with certified RNG. The game isn't rigged, though the house edge ensures profitability for the casino over time.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Cricket X is a simple game to learn but requires discipline to play responsibly. The core mechanic - betting, watching the multiplier, and deciding when to cash out - creates genuine excitement even though the outcome is mathematically random.</p>

            <p>Remember these key points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set and stick to budgets and time limits</li>
                <li>Try demo mode before playing with real money</li>
                <li>Use auto cash-out to remove emotional decisions</li>
                <li>Accept that the house edge means expected long-term loss</li>
                <li>Never chase losses or believe in patterns</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you choose to play Cricket X, do so for entertainment, not profit. Treat any money wagered as the cost of that entertainment. And if gambling ever becomes more than entertainment, please seek help immediately.</p>
